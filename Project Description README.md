# CovidPortfolioProject

**Project Description**:
For my first data analyst portfolio project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data related to deaths and vaccinations. The project aimed to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic, the progress of vaccination campaigns, and the relationship between COVID-19 cases, deaths, and population demographics.

**My Role**:
I collected and analysed COVID-19 data from two distinct datasets: one containing information about COVID deaths and the other detailing COVID vaccinations. My role involved data integration, exploratory data analysis, and the creation of meaningful visualisations and metrics to convey key insights. Additionally, I created interactive visualisations using Tableau Public to provide a dynamic and user-friendly way to explore the data.

**Key Achievements**:

- **Data Integration**: I successfully integrated data from the COVID deaths and vaccinations datasets, aligning them by location and date to facilitate meaningful analysis.
- **Vaccination Trends**: I tracked and visualised the progress of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns worldwide, calculating rolling totals of vaccinated individuals to gauge the percentage of the population covered.
- **Mortality Analysis**: I conducted a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 mortality rates, identifying countries with the highest death counts and exploring mortality trends across continents.
- **Population Impact**: I assessed the impact of COVID-19 on populations by calculating the percentage of people infected and vaccinated in relation to the total population.
- **Tableau Visualisations**: I leveraged Tableau to create interactive and visually compelling data visualisations that enhanced the project's accessibility and user engagement.

**Technologies/Tools Used**:

- SQL: To query and manipulate data from the COVID-19 datasets.
- Azure Data Studio: For database management and querying, creating views, temporary tables, and performing data transformations.
- Data Visualisation: Tableau was employed to design interactive and informative data visualisations, adding an extra layer of insight to the project's findings.

**Notable Outcomes/Results**:

- The project provided a clear visualisation of the global progress of COVID-19 vaccinations and highlighted countries with the highest vaccination rates.
- Mortality analysis revealed key insights into regions with the highest COVID-19 death counts, shedding light on areas that may require additional healthcare resources.
- The percentage of the population infected and vaccinated was calculated, offering a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact on different countries and populations.
- Interactive Tableau visualisations enhanced user engagement and provided an intuitive way to explore and interact with the data, fostering a deeper understanding of the pandemic's dynamics.

Overall, this being my first project, it demonstrated my skill in data analysis, integration, and visualisation to create dynamic and informative visual representations of the COVID-19 data.
